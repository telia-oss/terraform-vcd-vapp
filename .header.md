Create set of VMs in vCloud Director, and vApp(s) to contain them.

This module creates the `vcd_vapp` resource as well as `vcd_vapp_vm` resources along with any `vcd_vm_internal_disk`s or `vcd_vapp_org_network`s that are required. Other resources (like `vcd_independent_disk`s to be attached) will have to be created outside of this module. It assumes that the `vcd` provider has already been configured.

VMs are created by passing a `map` called `vms` of their names to their parameters to the module. Configuring VM parameters is done in two ways:
- Passing a parameter with the appropriate value to the module - this sets a default for all VMs that will be created.
- Adding an attribute to the appropriate object in the `vms` map - this will set a VM-specific parameter or override the module default.

`vapp_name` can be specified as a parameter for the module or an attribute for the VM. If neither is specified, `vapp_name` will default to the VM name. Correct amount of `vcd_vapp` resources will be automatically created and the VMs sharing the same `vapp_name` will be associated with a single `vcd_vapp` instance.

Names and formats of the parameters were taken from the [vcd](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs) module to avoid confusion.
